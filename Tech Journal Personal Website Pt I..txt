4/18:
        After completing the personal website pt. 1 project, 
        I am able to take away several key pieces of knowledge relating to web development. 
        Over the last 4 days, I have been able to expand my knowledge of css properties like:
         border interactions, flexbox and have increased my overall design ability. 
         At the same time I have a more concrete understanding of how html tags function both in relation to each other, 
         and with css formatting.
